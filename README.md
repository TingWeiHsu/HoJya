# HoJya - Taiwanese food website


### Purpose: 
To introduce Taiwanese food for foreigners (Japanese version)

### Stacks: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Fullpage.js, Firebase Database and Storage, Mocha, Google Analytics

### Motivation:
The reason why I did this project is that when I was working in Japan, many Japanese people asked me lots of questions
about Taiwan, especially food.  However, every time when I search the photos in order to show them how tasty the Taiwanese
food are, I found that most of photos looks not good and also lack of appropriate introduction.  Moreover, I keep thinking
that we have so many fantastic food in Taiwan but why people in the world only know sushi and kimchi.
Therefore, I decided to make a site which looks like the encyclopedia of Taiwanese food.

### Speciality:
Emphasis on user experience
